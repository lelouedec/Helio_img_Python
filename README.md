## SECCHI 

### HI
Refactor of the code from https://github.com/maikebauer/STEREO-HI-Data-Processing for SECCHI HI-1 and HI-2 (most is ported just missing running differences and jplot creation, coming soon)

### COR2

Most of COR2 reduction is working and implemented, missing calibration


## LASCO

### C3
Working on having C3 working fully, nearly at the end of Reduce_L1.pro 


Will add soon how to use code, one can look at config.yaml for an idea and use: python main.py config.yaml to execute reduction and downloading. (Might have to download pointing files and calibration for HI manually for now).
